      <h2>Morel Orel Tags </h2>
      <p> This is a Moral Orel fan Website. Moral Orel is a Stop motion animated series on Adult swim, that follows Orel Puppington, an innocent protestant 12 year old who misunderstands the advice of townsfolk while on a journey to be the best christian he can be. Much like himself the people of Moralton are devout Protestant, as Statesota is believed to be along the bible belt. The time in which the series is set is not clear but many believe it to be in the 2000's. Whilst this may be the case, the Town of Moralton clearly follows 1950's to 1960's conservative culture and values. This is due to the technology that Moralton has at their disposal whilst also isolating themselves and following out of date ideas on the rest of the world. </p>

      <h2>The begginings of Moral Orel </h2>
      <p> Moral Orel started off very early for Dino Stamatopoulos, as a loose script modeled after "Leave it to Beaver" 
        and later presented to various people leading him to gigs. Until eventually someone suggested he make something out 
        of it, making for one of the first episodes to be written out and branched out to other various ideas.
         Deciding that the misinterpretation of religious would be a good element to add, he wrote out ten tight 
         to build up the world of Orel with much dialoge thinking it would be expensive to animate action. Within 3 months
        he had laid out all the episodes and got to work with his team to start the long process of stop-motion animation. Within a
        few weeks he had his voiceovers and it was time to stitch everyones work together. Within 7 months, all 10 episodes
        were prodcued and ready to air on Adult Swim.

      <p> This is a Moral Orel fan Website. Moral Orel is a Stop motion animated series on Adult swim, that follows Orel Puppington, an innocent protestant 12 year old who misunderstands the advice of townsfolk while on a journey to be the best christian he can be. Much like himself the people of Moralton are devout Protestant, as Statesota is believed to be along the bible belt. The time in which the series is set is not clear but many believe it to be in the 2000's. Whilst this may be the case, the Town of Moralton clearly follows 1950's to 1960's conservative culture and values. This is due to the technology that Moralton has at their disposal whilst also isolating themselves and following out of date ideas on the rest of the world. </p>

      <h3> Orel Puppington and his family"
      <p> The Moral Orel show follows a saterized version of the Religious American lifestyle. Some would call it a dark paradoy of the "Leave it to Beaver" show and "Davey and Goliath". "Davey and Goliath" was a religious show exploring the christian faith,using lively claymation. "Leave it to Beaver" follwed another young boy and his adventures leading him to misunderstandings where his father would ultimately teach him a lesson. Throughout the first season of Moral Orel, each episode would take a uniform formula. Having each episode start anew like the last episode didnt happen or wasnt of particular significance such as the epdisode after the apocalypse had started becuase of Orel. </p>
